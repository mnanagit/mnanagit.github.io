title: "Climate Shocks and the Distribution of Income and Wealth: Evidence from 159 Countries, 1980â€“2023"
date: 2025-03-01
abstract: "This paper investigates the effects of temperature variations on income and wealth distribution in 159 countries (1980-2023) using WID and climate data. Results from fixed-effects and local projections indicate extreme temperatures significantly reduce income growth nonlinearly, while wealth shows no statistically significant response. Implications for climate policy are discussed."
