title: "Healthy Diets in Eight West African Countries: Access and Preferences"
date: 2025-06-01
abstract: "Using household data from eight WAEMU countries, this paper examines the relationship between income, healthy diet affordability, and consumption. We find that while healthy diet affordability improves with income, this does not proportionally translate to better dietary intake. Higher income elasticity for less healthy goods suggests income growth alone may not improve nutrition. This highlights the need for targeted, food-based policies over simple income transfers, despite logistical challenges."
